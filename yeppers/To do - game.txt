MAJOR TODO
Using simpleini https://github.com/brofield/simpleini REMEMBER TO PUT THE LICENCE FILE FOR IT IN FOLDER AND TO CREDIT THE CREATOR

MINOR TODO
physics may need to be slightly shifted, particularily for player handle as it seems to be a little bit slippery currently
possibly convert some of the forward momentum into side momentum as well to make it seem liek its still moving in a certain direction
