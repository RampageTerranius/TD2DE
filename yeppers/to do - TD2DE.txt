TD2DE Development State

DONE	100% hardware rendering (done using 2d textures)
NO		0%	 software rendering option for lower end devices (using surface blitting instead of texture rendering)
DONE	90%	 automatically handling loading images and blitting them (mostly done, may have to make functions to accept things other then .png format at some point)
DONE	100% setup textue rendering to be automatic and a layering system
DONE	100% Handling rotation of objects
STARTED	5%	 Sprite class for easy use of sprites, will need to inherit the base texture class and add extra stuff ontop
DONE	90%  handling all keyboard buttons that could be pressed (may require more at later time but basically done now)
NO		0%	 Handling controller input 
DONE	90%  mouse handling and use with button class (automatic detection of a clicked user created button) more may need to be doen in future
STARTED	75%	 timing system for internal engine (internal loop time limit)
DONE	100% frame rate limiter and cap
DONE	100% classes based around controlling objects (players, enemys etc)
DONE    100% convert existing momentum handle to work for ALL of the object class
DONE	95%	 class based around control and creation of buttons (menu buttons and the like) more will be requried for the future but in its current state its fully useable
DONE	95%  Add transparency layer for image loading/rendering
DONE	90%	 ttf text working (possible fixes needed but is functioning currently)
NO		0%	 console for entering commands into the engine, will require ttf to be working first
DONE	95%	 audio file loading and playing
NO		0%	 lighting/shadow engine
NO		0%	 Conversion of current entity/ui/button classes all to use entity as the base (possibly using a linked list as well, will require being able to use multiple classes in same array)


EXTREMELY MAJOR TODO
rebuild of texture/object rendering is in progress requires object list creation and deleteion
check if the vectors for each object type are creating blank spots, possibe but shouldnt be happening
change ObjList to use a list isntead of using a vector

MAJOR TODO
Button class: create a propper event handle procedure instead of requiring the user to ask what state the button is in
Engine class: engine fps seems to be slightly off (limited at 60 its hitting 64) it could be a issue with the fps checker OR the engine really is running faster then it should...
Texture Class: rendering is currently somewhat slow, find out the cause and fix it (may be trying to load the texture each time its used?)
maxlayer system is currently not working corectly (always stuck at 1)
change of layer system is required, limit to 3, 0 for back 1 for middle 2 for front shoudl work fine (ui locked to 2)

MINOR TODO
keyboard class: enter keystroke is using sdlk_return currently and not sure this is what key im after

image rotation has a slight antialiasing to the image (semi transparent border around image) when on linear or higher setting. fix this at a later point, may require coding own aliasing or modifying the transperancy layer
